			<h2 id="childhood"><h1>CHILDHOOD DAYS</h1></h2>
			
				<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in a small town in Metro Manila, the youngest of three children<sup>1</sup>. Growing up, my parents encouraged me to pursue my passions and to always strive to do my best<sup>2</sup>. I had a love of learning from a young age and was a very curious child<sup>3</sup>. I spent most of my childhood exploring the outdoors, playing sports, and participating in a variety of extracurricular activities<sup>4</sup>. I had a close relationship with my siblings and we were always supportive of each other<sup>5</sup>. I was a creative and imaginative kid, always coming up with ideas and ways to try new things<sup>6</sup>. I was also a kind and empathetic person, always wanting to help others and put a smile on their face<sup>7</sup>. I was active in my church, helping out with various programs and initiatives<sup>8</sup>. I also volunteered in my community, lending a helping hand whenever I could<sup>9</sup>.
I remember my childhood with fondness, the sense of freedom and adventure I felt was unparalleled<sup>10</sup>. Every day was an exciting new journey, full of new and unknown experiences<sup>11</sup>. I had endless energy, a burning curiosity and an eagerness to explore<sup>12</sup>. I was in constant awe of the world around me and the beauty of nature<sup>13</sup>. 
I spent hours playing with my siblings in the garden, climbing trees, and running around<sup>13</sup>. I often pretended I was an astronaut or a superhero, going on daring adventures and defeating enemies<sup>14</sup>. Imagination was my best friend and I was always looking for new places to explore<sup>15</sup>. 
On sunny days, I would ride my bike around the neighborhood and explore the nearby parks<sup>16</sup>. I would play tag with my friends, playing hide-and-seek in the woods, and running around the fields<sup>17</sup>. There was nothing better than feeling the wind in my hair while pedaling as fast as I could<sup>18</sup>. 
I also loved going to the beach and building sandcastles<sup>19</sup>. The smell of the sea, the sound of the waves crashing, and the warmth of the sand was a magical experience<sup>20</sup>. There was nothing more calming and relaxing than spending my days swimming, sunbathing, and collecting shells<sup>21</sup>.</p>
